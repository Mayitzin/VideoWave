# VideoWave

This small application creates a sound wave and superimposes it on each frame of a video.

Check a small description of its inner workings in its [original post](https://mariogc.com/post/videowave/).

## Requirements

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to handle video encoding/decoding
- [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to create the visuals (waves)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) to get the spectral information of the audio
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) to handle the data
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is not really needed, but shows the intermediate data, if you want to know what's happening behind scenes.

## Usage

```python
from VideoWave import Waver
wave_clip = Waver("clip.mp4")
wave_clip.export("new_clip.mp4")
```

And that's it. You have now a new clip with audio waves on top of the image looking like this:
